# us-equities-portfolio-demos

## Description
This project presents an advanced portfolio optimization strategy tailored for US equities. It integrates risk and alpha factors while accounting for linear transaction costs to achieve optimal performance. Central to this strategy is a CatBoost-based non-overlapping estimator, designed to enhance medium-frequency trading by effectively combining alpha factors. For a robust analysis of these factors, Alphalens is utilized to thoroughly evaluate their performance. Comprehensive backtesting and dynamic portfolio rebalancing are executed using Zipline, ensuring the strategy's practical applicability and reliability in real-world scenarios.
